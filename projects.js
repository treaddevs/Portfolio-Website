Next to the first image, I included a container to explain GO.DO. and an overlay section that allows the user can view when clicking on the "Take the Tour" button. I intalled a Swiper.js slideshow component so the user can view toggle through the images in the slideshow and view the titles stored on Storyblok. I included pagination so the user can see what image they are viewing in the series. Exiting the overlay, below this section there are three more image cards stacked on top of each other.',
            details3: 'The biggest challenges for me were navigating the Tailwind CSS utility classes as these were new to me, and ensuring the best view on mobile. On mobile, I used the CSS clamp() function to ensure font sizes were readable and changed the visibilty for how the header section with the GO.DO. text would display based on screen size. For wider screens, the GO.DO. text and tour button appear adjacent to the transition image, while on mobile they stack vertically to save space and ensure readability.',
