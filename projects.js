            details: 'The internship began on May 28 as I started modifying Vue.js components to be displayed on <a href="https://theviaagency.com" target="_blank">The VIA Agency website</a>. Initially, I started working on the footer component, restructuring it to have its contents stack vertically when viewing on mobile. After this, I was assigned the GO.DO. component from the Culture section to work on.',
            details2: 'Basing my development on the Figma design file, I added a transition to the first image card allowing it to fade in and slide into place from the left. Next to the first image, I included a container to explain GO.DO. and an overlay section that allows the user can view when clicking on the "Take the Tour" button. I intalled a Swiper.js slideshow component so the user can view toggle through the images in the slideshow and view the titles stored on Storyblok. I included pagination so the user can see what image they are viewing in the series. Exiting the overlay, below this section there are three more image cards stacked on top of each other.',
            details3: 'The biggest challenges for me were navigating the Tailwind CSS utility classes as these were new to me, and ensuring the best view on mobile. On mobile, I used the CSS clamp() function to ensure font sizes were readable and changed the visibilty for how the header section with the GO.DO. text would display based on screen size. For wider screens, the GO.DO. text and tour button appear adjacent to the transition image, while on mobile they stack vertically to save space and ensure readability.',

Our team set out to develop a working AI chatbot for <a href="https://www.armandhammer.com/en/for-everything-soda" target="_blank">ARM & HAMMERâ„¢ Baking Soda</a>. Using <a href="https://botpress.com/" target="_blank">Botpress</a>, I trained the AI knowledge base on the contents of the website and the individual project/recipe pages. Connecting the Botpress nodes together allowed for developing a basic logical flow to the conversation.'
